[While reading Fluent Python 2nd edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fluent-python-2nd/9781492056348/), I am using this repos to learn about:

* OOP Python + Pandas
  * Actually update to Python 3.7+ dataclasses that are newer
* Calling Rust from Python
* Developing an interface in Python
  * https://nicegui.io/
  * call in spreadsheet from google spreadsheets of tasks or something like that
* Polars in Python
* Package development
* Github for releases
* Adv unit testing
  * https://realpython.com/python-unittest/
* Develop an API
* Documentation writing in Python
* Date-time conversion in Python ahhh
* Visualizations
* Login for user maybe later
* Host somewhere like Streamlit
* Reading a csv from Google spreadsheets (collaboration friendly)
* Using an AI API to suggest related tasks, fill in missing information etc.
